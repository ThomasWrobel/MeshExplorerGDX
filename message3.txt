This is cool. Its like some sort of semantic based network. Each domain adds its knowledge
to the network.
Semantics are really cool. Awesome in fact. Transitional inherirance of knowledge alone plus
crossreferancing equals massive deductive power.
Everyone should love semantic systems.Knowledge linked together in a structure, like a mesh of propertys and subpropertys,
allowing different concepts to be related, allowing reality to be interpreted by humans and machines alike. Semantics in many ways is knowledge
Subject Object Verb. Subject Predicate Value.  Semantics! Semantics!
Semantics!
