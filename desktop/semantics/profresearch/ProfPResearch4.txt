[To: Myself]

Took a bit longer then expected, but finished a prototype weapon to use against the creatures.
It fires a beam of data filled with the concept you specify. The creatures seem to take this data into themselves till 
they decompile(?) and vanish.
Different creatures seem vulnerable to different concepts. Specificly they seem to have a vulerability to anything
that forfils a semanticly checked set of propertys.

Anyway, I'm off to test it by shotting things.
