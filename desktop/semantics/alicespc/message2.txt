[To Myself]

WTF...this protocol is weird.
Ok, notes for future me!
Pay attention me!

1. Security is TERRIBLE. I mean, really poor.
2. But odd.
3. Its based around object identification. Enter a object that forfills the requirements
and your granted access.
4. The Prof gave me a few objects from his explorations - I think he got them from locations
that were already here before we arrived. Who made them?!?!!?
5. To store these concepts I made a "STMem" ability plugin for the MeshExplorer client. Provided a GUI is installed, this should be able to be installed too
acting as a inventory.
6. I dont understand how the Prof locked his PC without understanding the security system...thats odd. I should ask.
7. But first I am getting icecream.

bye!
