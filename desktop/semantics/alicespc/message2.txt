[To Myself]

WTF...this protocol is weird.
Ok, notes for future me!
Pay attention me!

1. Security is TERRIBLE. I mean, really poor.
2. But odd.
3. Its based around object identification. Enter a object that forfills the requirements
and your granted access.
4. The Prof gave me a few objects from his explorations - I think he got them from locations
that were already here before we arrived. Who made them?!?!!?
5. I am getting icecream.

bye!
