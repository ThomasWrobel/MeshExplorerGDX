Rough description;

The MeshExplorer is your interface, the car to let you chart new
courses over this digital ocean.

It reprograms your network interface to interpret the analoge sub-signals
hidden under the normal internet traffic into a form your computer can understand.
This hidden "mesh" consists of various locations and enities (<creatures?>) we dont fully understand.
Some clearly made by other explorers (<meshplorers?>), but some stuff....who knows where it comes from?

Your MeshExplorer lets you both navigate and interact with stuff around in the Mesh.
Specifically you can interact with "Concepts" - which seem to be a key part of this new <world?domain?>.
Concepts seem to be able to represent anything....things,ideas,colours,peoples. They can also be used.

Scanning a ability concept will let the MeshExplorer gain that ability, for example.
Other concepts seem to be used to allow access to locations.

Have fun exploring.
