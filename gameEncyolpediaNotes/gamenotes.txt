exploration stages;

1. intro, learn its a second layer to the internet
basic node collection.
see some creatures, but dont know they are creatures yet.

2. learn how to "unlock" locations. encouter cats location, but cant read it (first unreadable stuff). Cat1 requires fish to open. Links too Cat2 that requires many types of fish.

3. Go to first remote location. Learn about languages. Gain first ability (decode language1)
(more creatures here, a different sort)

4. Using new nodes gained, can unlock profs research node.
Mentions creatures for the first time. Speculates they might react
to data.


- learn creatures eat data, use it up
- learn creatures adapt and each population will only be vulnerable to each type of data once
- learn computers arnt locked, they are corrupted. Prof didnt lock his machine

Main game ideas;

- Concept gun (can be equiped with different objects that determain beams propertys)
  * objects get used up slower then directly giving them (due to guns rating ratio)
	
	concepts to load into gun (should have visual effects)
	 color = effects color, naturally
	 big/small = beams width
	 
	 posion = damage over time effect
	 fire = damage over time effect
	 freeze = stops movement, puts out fire
	 chain = leaps from one to another
	 wind = spreads them out 
	 
	 in addition to these effects the concept can apply its own unique property (ie, milk would effect lactor intolrent nodes)
	 
	 
	 Gun level determains concept complexity (ie, how many classes it can have)
	 
	 
	 
	 
Location tools;

	 (these are seperate single use locations. They are locked like others, but the metaphor for unlocking is "needing research data"
	 to complete something)
	
	 - gain mutator device? (but only after dealing with a few populations in other ways)
	
	 
	 - Research hub: Dump *any* concept here to start research. After its done the results will appear 
	 in one of the following sub locations;
	 
	 - Concepts anylsed - displays details of any concept not recognised as anything else below
	 
	 - Abilities anylised - displayes details of unlocked abilities.
	 
	 - Creatures anaylised (How to detect what creature to anylise?)
	  (once aynalised if the creature is a new unique type it goes on the family tree, which acts as a database of creatures.
	   Subtypes found get recorded on the same node description of the tree)
	  
	 - Genology Tree (creatures types have a parent species which is used to datermain there position on this gene tree. 
	 				  The gene tree doesnt do anything, but clicking on any species gives full details of a species, and
	 				  anaylising a species for the first time gives a small boast to damage against them, and maybe other stuff
	 				  depending) [possible #/# listing of subtypes found for each species?
	 
	 - Timeline entry (Lore/plot - as knowledge is gained you build a timeline of events up that tell the story of how this world formed and whats
	 			 going on)
	 
 	 - Ecnylopedia entry - acts as a help system, as well as extra lore. Occasionally opening a page might unlock something or a boast?.
 	 				 Encylopedia entries dont need researching, they are automatically on the research tree.
  
  	 - People profile pages - little summeries of people you may meet
  	 
  	 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The goal will both unlockables and boasts is too provide many different rewards for doing stuff, and many types of collectables
  for people to get.
  Upgrades should ALWAYS have a noticable effect. No +1 stat out of 100. Stat boasts always should make a noticable difference
  and there shouldn't be many in total per catagory.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlockables (lets you do new things);

- Free movement mode (unlocked almost straight away after the tutorial) 
- Your own stat page (single unlock near the start, shows all your current stats/upgrades)
- Language packs (let you read text of non-Ascii locations)

- Creature stats/info (see above)
- Enclyopedia entries (see above)
- Timeline points (see above)
- People profile entries (brief summeries of various people you meet)
- Music tracks (overrides default track, can be enabled/disabled)


- Color customiser (just lets you R/G/B your own location, and UI interface. Pointless)
- Game Icon changer (another pointless thing, lets you switch the games launch icon. Might not be practical...but cool if possible)

- Location revealer?? (ping like device that reveals hidden/cloaked unlinked locations?)
- Flipside compatible zoom? (lets your camera zoom around to see the other side of locations...some of which contain hidden stuff. Have to be carefull concept gun puzzles arnt broken when allowing this)
- Concept bombs (gun add-on, very very slow recharge, drops a concept down which expodes a few seconds latter)


Upgrades/Boast (expands/changes existing things):
 
- More download slots at once
- Faster downloads
- Gun that holds more charge.
- Gun that recharges faster.
- Gun that takes two concept slots
- Concept bomb recharge quicker.
- Bigger temp inventory (carry more concepts)
- All creatures can have a  boast to do more damage against them
- Creature attraction radius of dropped things increase.
- Research speed boast
- More simultanious researchs allowed (much like scans)
 
//--------------------------------------
Creature types;

* Vulnerable just to clicks
* Vulnerable to milk,cheese,yogaurt,etc 
* Vulnerable to fruit

Population types;

* light investation (surrounds location, but doesnt interfere)
  - gives drops

* heavy. (blocks locations use by swaming over it/greying it out. ALL have to be removed
to open location)

Characters;

ProP - studys and explorers the locations. uses outdated lingo.
Bob - shared client with you. irrasponsible
Alice - exodecypter. likes icecream. low attention span.
Cat - a cat? speaks Moew.

Darkflame - first remote terminal...exadurated me

Unused;

Gondalwind - 

Lock/puzzle ideas;
-----------------

Name 6 doctors (doctor who actors count, as does any fictional doctor)

Opersite lock - each clue has something you need to give the opersite off (many locks)

Language lock - "Hello?Hello?Hello?" (reply with Hellos in any 3 languages)

Property - "Melting point over 300+solid" (materials like tungstan)
         - Alive, non Vertebrate
         
Large quanitys - 10 lifeforms or 10 round things

Maths Puzzle - basic sum/answer

Quiz - name the 5 Marx brothers
	 - a marvel/dc superhero 
	 - acted in films X and Y



Complete - complete a sentance? 
		 - Complete a set (some already filled in?)
		 





Letters

Darkflame


This is cool. Its like some sort of semantic based network. Each domain adds its knowledge
to the network.
Semantics are really cool. Awesome in fact. Transitional inherirance of knowledge alone plus
crossreferancing equals massive deductive power.
Everyone should love semantic systems.Knowledge linked together in a structure, like a mesh of propertys and subpropertys,
allowing different concepts to be related, allowing reality to be interpreted by humans and machines alike. Semantics in many ways is knowledge
Subject Object Verb. Subject Predicate Value.  Semantics! Semantics!
Semantics!
--
AR is cool too. Augmented Reality. One day we will live in a half virtual world. I am sure of it.
Anyone seen Dennou Coil? You should!
--
I know Semantic AR!! No...wait...that makes no sense. Also Why do I keep emailing myself. ? 
--
oh, I also spotted some weird...things...around some locations.  Anyone else spotted them? I thought they were just random data 
at first, but they seem to respond to interaction. 


How to handle creature movements?

- Movement is defined by basic actions nodes
- [Turn X left],[Turn X right],[Turn Towards <Point>],[Move Forward X],[Move Back X]

- Node file can determain a set of sub-actions to proform under an action
"[Run From <Point>]" contains "[Turn Towards <Point>],[Turn 180 right],[Move Forward X]"

- Node file can determain action to do under conditions


- Creatures have a updatePosition() function which calls getPosition(delta) from their animationController

- getPosition(delta) in animation controller returns the position based on the current action. If it reachs the end 
of the current action, it skips to the next action in its current list and returns the position in that





Widgets to make (done)

1. Mock GWT label - scalable in 3d using distance map fonts (or whatever its calleD). Has all the basic propertys of a label.

2. Vertical/Horizontal panel - can accept the above label for now, but support it via a GWTish widget interface
