Rough description;

The Mesh.

The regular internet is composed of digital signals being routed via a TCP/IP system, letting computers find eachother by taking various 
possible routes around the intermediate connections. It was a open standard invented by US government agency DARPA and quickly adopted. 
The WorldWideWide was invented by TimBurnersLee a few years later - providing the http and html protocals that communicate ontop of TCP/IP,
allowing a visual, user-friendly interface to be developed enabling people to contribute and read from the internet without technical skills

The Mesh however is something else completely.
It is not digital. It is a analogue set of signals hiding under the digital ones. Most routers and computers dismiss it as noise to be filtered out
Junk from stary electromagnetic waves.
However, some groups have simultaniously found its something more.
It has a structure. Links. Data. Stuff.
Its not just random noise, but a whole new network, allthough a very strange one.
Aside from being analogue, not digital, it seems not to have been created by anyone. No government agency, no CERN contractor, nobody.
Which is weird.
