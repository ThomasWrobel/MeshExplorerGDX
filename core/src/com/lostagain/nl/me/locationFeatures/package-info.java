 * Location.java - the main class concerning the location
 * LocationHub.java - the current interface to the other features

 * In future we might do away with the hub and have a node like system of hovering about icons that are linked together and can be expanded
 * to access their "screen" to interact with
 * This might help increase the sense of exploration and the differances between locations
