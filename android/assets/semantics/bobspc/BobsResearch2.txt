[To: Bob]

Hay Bob, I granted you access to access to this...thing...whatever this is.
It seems to exist as a second layer to our internet. 
Somehow it existed without anyone noticing...
..some sort of sub protocol.
Anyway, I granted you access in order to test my client access ssystem.
PLEASE dont spread it to anyone else.
