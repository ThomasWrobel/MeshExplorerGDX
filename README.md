MeshExplorerGDX
===============

A crossplatform game made with LibGDX using SuperSimpleSemantics to allow anyone to contribute bits to it.

Its primarily made to test and demo the SSS system - an open transitional semantic database that can work with distributed data over many severs
simply be hosting list files. The SSS is a Java project, tested to run on GWT Javascript,Android and desktop. (but should run on anything else that can compile
basic java).
Because of the cross platform and distributed nature of the SSS system it made sense to make a game that can take advantage of the game
features.
As such "MeshExplore" is a game where you explore a secret network - a odd secondary layer to the internet with mysterious origins.
Anyone can add nodes to this network (IRL) simply by adding a text file or two to their domain, and getting another persons domain in the game to link to them.
(People wishing me to link their constributions up can contact me direct and I'll add their node connecting to one of the initial points in the game).

The gameplay will try to take advantage of basic transitional semantic knowledge for puzzles and interaction, allthough
graphically and action wise it will be very low-key. Think "uplink" style gameplay.

I also welcome any help and contributions to the project!
If your interesting in help develop a distributed hacking/exploration game, let me know.

Currently working;

* Location nodes and links between them.
* GUI to let you pick up and use data items. (inventory has layout problems atm)
* Nodes can be closed and need specific data to uplock
* Nodes can contain data
* Nodes have email like files explaining plot points and such.
* Nodes can be encrpyted with a language
* Nodes can contain ability files  - currently only 1 to decrypt languages
* ...(probably more, I dont update this file too often...)


Partial implemented
* creature populations that inhabit locations.
