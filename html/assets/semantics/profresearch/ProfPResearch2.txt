[To: Myself]

I have noticed the "creatures" (creative naming isnt my strong point) seem to be responsible for damaging some locations.

I was alerted to this fact after Alice informed me my main location was "locked" and she had to "break in".
Given I never locked it I realised it was a form of corruption. 
Locations somehow get corrupted by the creatures and require to be 
supplied the correct concepts to repair the corruption enough to unlock them.

Of course, deliberate corruption could be done to lock a location. Maybe some other explorers are taking advantage of this.
Still, the majority of locations are probably "locked" accidently.

Purhapes we should try to fix them as we come accross them?

I should also work on some way to eliminate the creatures. What seemed to be a curisoty does now seem
to be dangerious. It would be a shame if this...place?...got destroyed before we work out where it came from.
