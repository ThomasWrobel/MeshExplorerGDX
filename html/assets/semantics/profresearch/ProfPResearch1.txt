[To: Myself]

On first exploring this <hidden protocol? subnet? darker net???> I was supprised to notice
what seemed to be moving <anaomlies? code packets? datablobs?> between the location points.

While the locations themselves are one mystery, these...things...compound it further.

They seem to cluster around locations but show no sign of infection or replication...so not virus's.

Like the locations (other then our own) no obvious sign of where they come from. 
Unlike the locations that seem filled with human-created data, these things dont have any obvious purpose or goal.
I'll continue to explore this <alter-net? wacky web?> and will try to deduce their nature.

NB: Must come up with better names for things
